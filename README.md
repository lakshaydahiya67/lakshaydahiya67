:man_technologist: About Me :
I am a Full-Stack Python Developer with a deep passion for building robust, scalable, and intelligent web applications from the ground up. I specialize in using Django and FastAPI to create secure, feature-rich systems and have a keen interest in integrating AI/ML, real-time features, and financial technology into my projects.

🔭 I’m currently working on enhancing my project management platform with more advanced analytics.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about microservices architecture and advanced DevOps practices.
